# Encog Language Detection Neural Network

## Quick Start

* Run the program
* From the main menu, simply choose the options numbered 1 to 4 in order to build the dataset, build the network, train the network and validate the network against the training set, respectively. 
* **Note** that a .csv file containing all vectors is created in the root of the project after running option #1 and this file can grow quite large depending on the vector Length and the min/max NGram size.

### Example Output

Hardware: Ryzen 3700X CPU (16-threads @3.6Ghz)

* Total Training Time: 82.970310s
* Results Correct: 11560/11738
* Accuracy: 98.483558%

#### Don't forget to take a look at the [PDF version of the Readme](https://github.com/SerjiVutinss/EncogLanguageNeuralNetwork/blob/master/README.pdf) for more detail on design choices and performance of the Neural Network.
